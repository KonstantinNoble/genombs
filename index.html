        <h1>Synoptas – Three Opinions, One Decision</h1>
        <p>Making a tough call? We get it. Before you commit, run your question through three different perspectives. See where they agree, where they don't, and what you might be missing.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Type your question</strong> – What are you actually trying to decide? Pricing, hiring, expansion – whatever's keeping you up at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Get three takes</strong> – Each perspective analyzes your situation independently, without seeing what the others said.</li>
          <li><strong>See the pattern</strong> – We show you where all three agree (move forward with confidence), where two agree, and where opinions differ (worth digging into).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>What You Get</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consensus view</strong> – When everyone agrees, you're probably on the right track.</li>
          <li><strong>Dissent points</strong> – When they disagree, that's where you need to think harder.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk and boldness sliders</strong> – Adjust how conservative or aggressive you want the recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision tracking</strong> – Turn decisions into experiments and see what actually happens.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        <h3>What's this for?</h3>
        <p>Business decisions where you want more than your own perspective. Should I raise prices? Hire now or wait? Enter this market or that one? That kind of thing.</p>
        
        <h3>Why three opinions instead of one?</h3>
        <p>One answer is a guess. Three answers that agree? That's a pattern. And when they disagree, you know exactly where to focus your research.</p>
        
        <h3>What if the opinions conflict?</h3>
        <p>That's useful information. It means the answer isn't obvious, and you should probably look into that specific angle before deciding.</p>
        
        <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>Free: 2 checks per day. Premium: $26.99/month for 15 daily checks plus deeper analysis, competitor context, and long-term outlook.</p>
